// // from readme starter code
// You'll need to execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:

// * `Product` belongs to `Category`, and `Category` has many `Product` models, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

// * `Product` belongs to many `Tag` models, and `Tag` belongs to many `Product` models. Allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products by using the `ProductTag` through model.

// > **Hint:** Make sure you set up foreign key relationships that match the column we created in the respective models.
